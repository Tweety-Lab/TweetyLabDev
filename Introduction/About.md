# About
Hey there,

I'm a programmer with a focus on creating tools, engines, and libraries that simplify development and expand what's known as possible. My work spans everything from documentation generators and runtime libraries to game engines and modding frameworks, with a focus on modularity, productivity, and developer-first workflows.

If you're interested in some of my work, you can check out my [Portfolio](Portfolio.md). If you want to reach out about collaboration, ask some questions or simply have a chat **I'm available to contact** via email at `adam.g@tweety-lab.dev` or on Discord at `Tweety333`.
